## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for each page depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements throughout the site

### Screenshot

![](./screenshot.jpg)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it. 

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

**Note: Delete this note and the paragraphs above when you add your screenshot. If you prefer not to add a screenshot, feel free to remove this entire section.**

## My process

- the challenge has four pages which are the Home page, Stories page, Features and Pricing page.

### Reading the design files

- creating the reset file.
- create the sass variables for font-sizes, typography, spacings etc
- create utility classes - classes that have a special assignment
- read the design files for each page for mobile , tablet and desktop and vice-versa to 
analyse how to design and structure the html. That helps to see which components can be grouped
together to get the most of the required designs.
- simplify the reading by looking at components that are likely to be shared.  The common are usually 
the header and footer.

### creating the header and navigation

- the header comprises of the photosnap logo on the right which can be used as the home navigation
- on mobile devices on the right hand side there is a toggle button that opens and closes the rest of the 
navigation list items. I used `display: flex`
- on tablet and desktop the toggle button for mobile should be hidden and the navigation should always 
be displayed

### creating the main section

- all the pages has a similar layout of the hero section. It has an image and content section but displayed differently in some layout of the tablet and desktop section. The mobile is generally a top to bottom approach.

### What I learned

Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
