## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for each page depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements throughout the site

### Screenshot

## My process

- the challenge has four pages which are the Home page, Stories page, Features and Pricing page.

### Reading the design files

- creating the reset file.
- create the sass variables for font-sizes, typography, spacings etc
- create utility classes - classes that have a special assignment
- read the design files for each page for mobile , tablet and desktop and vice-versa to 
analyse how to design and structure the html. That helps to see which components can be grouped
together to get the most of the required designs.
- simplify the reading by looking at components that are likely to be shared.  The common are usually 
the header and footer.

### creating the header and navigation

- the header comprises of the photosnap logo on the right which can be used as the home navigation
- on mobile devices on the right hand side there is a toggle button that opens and closes the rest of the 
navigation list items. I used `display: flex`
- on tablet and desktop the toggle button for mobile should be hidden and the navigation should always 
be displayed

### creating the main section

#### Hero section

- all the pages has a similar layout of the hero section. It has an image and content section but displayed differently in some layout of the tablet and desktop section. The mobile is generally a top to bottom approach.

##### Hero section - home page , Feature Page and Pricing page

- the layout for the hero page on mobile has the image on top and the content is below
- for tablet and desktop the image is on the left and the content is on the right. The content takes about 2 fifth (2/5) of the available space while the image space is about 3 fifth (3/5). Displayed using flex.
